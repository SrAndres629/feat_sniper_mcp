## ☁️ The Cloud Protocol (Level 49)
Instead of 40 individual EMAs, the system synchronizes 4 primary layers.

### 1. Layers (Multifractal States)
- **Micro (Red)**: Reactivity and Immediate Intent.
- **Structure (Green)**: Operational Path and Immediate Trend.
- **Macro (Blue)**: Market Memory and Institutional Equilibrium.
- **Bias (Gray)**: Absolute Regime (2048 SMMA).

### 2. The Centroid Logic
Every layer has a **Centroid** (Center of Gravity) calculated as the mean of its component periods. 
- **Compression (Knot)**: Standard deviation of layer EMAs. Low SD = Potential explosion.
- **Expansion (Fan)**: High SD = Established trend.

### 3. Cognitive Patterns
- **EXPANSION**: Clean trend alignment (Price > Micro > Structure > Macro).
- **TRAP/COMPRESSION**: High compression (Knot) near structure walls.
- **DEEP_RETRACEMENT**: Price crosses structure but Macro remains strong.
- **REGIME_CHANGE**: Structural break validated by Macro flattening or reversal.

### 4. Semantic Control
The system identifies which layer is "In Control" by measuring the minimal distance from price to the layer centroids.
