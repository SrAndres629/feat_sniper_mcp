# Skill: SKILL FACTORY (Autonomous Evolution Protocol)

## 🏢 Description
Meta-skill designed to enable the AI Agent (Antigravity) to design, develop, and deploy new specialized "Skills". This protocol allows the system to self-evolve by creating new procedural modules when a repetitive task or a complex architectural requirement is identified. It transforms the AI from a simple coder into a **Quant-Dev Architect**.

## 🛠️ Evolution Workflow

### 1. Conceptual Design (The Neural Blueprint)
- **Problem Identification**: Detect a recurring pattern or a lack of specialized logic (e.g., a missing risk protocol or a new data parsing need).
- **Core Requirements**: Define what the skill must do (Input -> Process -> Output).
- **Naming Convention**: Use all-caps titles for skill names (e.g., `LIQUIDITY_AUDITOR`).

### 2. Scaffolding (Physical Creation)
- **Path**: Create the skill in `.ai/skills/[skill_name].md`.
- **Structure**:
    - **🛡️ Description**: High-level goal and rationale.
    - **🛠️ Workflow**: Step-by-step algorithmic protocol.
    - **🎯 Success Condition**: Measurable KPI or test pass requirement.

### 3. Verification & Calibration
- **Dry Run**: Simulate the skill's execution on a small sample file.
- **Peer Audit**: Use the `VERIFICATOR SENTINEL` to ensure the new skill doesn't conflict with existing architectural rules (e.g., the <300 line limit).

### 4. Integration
- **Central C2 Update**: Register the new skill in `.ai/context/architecture.md` and `.ai/context/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
- **Instructional Injection**: Update the AI's internal response logic to "understand" when to invoke this new tool.

## 🎯 Strategic Goal
Enable the AI to think as a **complete team of Senior Fullstack Developers and Data Scientists**, allowing it to create its own tools for system optimization.
