# Skill: CORTEX ARCHITECT (Neural Memory Optimization)

## 🧠 Description
Expert protocol for auditing and optimizing the `.ai/` directory, which serves as the "Cortex" or "Brain" of the Nexus system. Its mission is to prevent "Memory Drift", ensure the `Constitution` is followed, and refactor architecture files for maximum AI alignment. It treats the system's metadata as production code.

## 🛠️ Maintenance Workflow

### 1. Structural Audit
- **Directory Scan**: Analyze `.ai/context/`, `.ai/skills/`, and `.ai/workflows/`.
- **Entropy Detection**: Identify outdated instructions, contradictory rules, or missing project states.
- **Verification**: Check that every skill has a corresponding description in the architecture map.

### 2. State & Context Refactoring
- **Senior Fullstack Master PhD Protocol**: When auditing any core file, the architect MUST refactor logic until it achieves a "Master/PhD" level of mathematical fidelity, vectorization, and fail-safe robustness.
- **Atomic Updates**: Ensure `active_state.json` and `project_state.md` are in 1:1 sync with the physical reality of the codebase.
- **Deuda Técnica Registry**: Document pending refactoring tasks or architectural flaws in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
- **Fission of Skills**: If a `.md` skill file becomes too complex or overlaps with another, apply the "Skill Fission" (breaking it into specialized sub-skills).

### 3. AI Performance Calibration
- **Tone & Style Audit**: Revise the `CONSTITUTION.md` to sharpen the AI's professional persona (Chief AI Scientist).
- **Instructional Compression**: Refactor long instruction blocks into clear, bullet-point protocols to maximize the Agent's context window efficiency.

### 4. Integrity Validation
- **Circular Constraint Check**: Ensure that rules in one skill do not block the execution of another (deadlock detection for skills).

## 🎯 Success Condition
A `.ai/` directory that is 100% accurate, consistent, and provides the AI Agent with an ultra-high definition "mental map" of the project, enabling **PhD-level coding precision**.
