# Sub-Skill: Energy Systems (Thermodynamic Markets)
**Focus:** Entropy, Potential Energy, Kinetic Energy.
**Laws:**
- **Kinetic Energy:** $K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ where mass is volume and velocity is price change. High kinetic energy is required to break strong structural bonds.
- **Entropy:** Markets seek localized entropy maximization (volatility expansion) followed by minimization (consolidation).
- **Potential Energy:** Consolidations store potential energy. Breakouts convert potential to kinetic energy.
- **ATR as Temp:** ATR measures the system's "temperature" (thermal energy/volatility).
