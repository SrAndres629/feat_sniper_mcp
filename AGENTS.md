## 📜 High-Level Instructions
1. **Zero Context Killers**: Never include `.venv`, `node_modules`, or binary models in your analysis.
2. **Standardization**: Refer to `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for the current mathematical state before proposing changes.
3. **Synaptic Integrity**: Every code change must maintain 100% synchronization with the Convergence Engine.
